## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Configuration


### Running the project
Open 'index.html' to show the main page that allows you to upload a txt file and get the result.


### Unit tests (QUnit)
Go to the page "/tests/test.html".
This is unit tests, I have to enrich it, I know ^^ !

### How it works
You can upload txt files (let's see examples inside "/tests/resources/").

Here, a txt file content example :

```
5 5
1 2 N
LFLFLFLFF
3 3 E
FFRFFRFRRF
```

In the confirm popup, click "OK" to execute actions step by step or "Cancel" to directly go to result.
Check results in the right sidebar.

Run example:
